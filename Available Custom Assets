# Available Custom Assets

These assets have been developed by the ES Community for the use of all community developers. To access them, Subscribe as you would to any other room (but these aren't generally playable) then copy them into your workshop files. If you have any questions, ask us in our Discord channel!

## Openable Book (thanks Robin!)

An openable book that you can retexture, add text and use in your own room.
