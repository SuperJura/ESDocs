Those models with a generated box collider will have a check mark so you can choose if you want to use it in the game without using the Visibility Activator to disable it. This way you can easily parent the new Collider Components to the imported model and create your own colliders. When using the Visibility Activator Component for disabling Collider components you will need to disable each Collider component individually or parent them to an Empty and disable the Empty object. If you want even more performance it is recommended to modify the model and add colliders that way instead of adding the Collider Component children. When loading a model we check each mesh name and if the mesh name ends with \u201c#boxcollider\u201d we add a box collider (everything after the first \u201c.\u201d in the name is ignored so \u201cmeshname#boxcollider.001\u201d is still a valid collider name). In order to add a collider to the model you just need to add as many cube meshes as needed and size and rotate them to encompass most of the model. Most of the original prop colliders are created similarly using box colliders as children of the main rendering part. When the colliders have been added this way, the check mark for disabling the collider is removed, but you can use the Visibility Activator Component on it as usual."),(0,l.kt)("h2",{id:"deleting-a-model-from-the-_custommodels-folder"},"Deleting a model from the \u201c_CustomModels\u201d folder"),(0,l.kt)("p",null,"If the model was deleted while not in the editor and the files were not used in the room nothing will happen.
