Today you\'ll be able to find out for yourself by challenging them in Escape Simulator\'s brand-new Versus Update! Rise to the top of the ranks by being the first to solve all the puzzles in one of our many escape rooms. To commemorate this new way to play, we are also adding a truly challenging room that takes place on a quiz show from the 80s.\\n\\nFinally, we would like to challenge all of our community\'s incredibly talented room builders to create their own Versus rooms! That\'s right, **we are kicking off our fourth official Build-A-Room challenge TODAY**! As always, there are some awesome prizes involved. Be sure to keep reading for more information on this new Build-A-Room challenge down below!\\n\\nThe Versus Update is absolutely huge and it features a new game mode, new rooms, soundtrack, outfits, a few very interesting additions (such as \\"join random multiplayer lobby\\" option), and a bunch of fixes. The full massive **changelog is in the bottom of the page**.\\n\\n## But how does it work?\\n\\n![Versus Mode](./lb.gif)\\n\\nAs the title implies, in this brand-new Versus Mode, you will be able to take on other players to prove that you are the greatest escape artist. Just like in the regular Co-op Mode, one player will need to host a game to create a lobby for your opponents to join. Once that\'s settled, you\u2019ll have to select a room that each of you will be tackling individually. You can choose any room you want, even the community rooms made in the in-game room editor!\\n\\nOnce you\'ve selected and entered a room, the game begins. In order to keep track of how far along your opponents are, we\'ve added an in-game progress bar that shows you exactly whether you\'re ahead of the game or if you should step it up a notch! This progress bar will allow you to see the exact progress of your opponents. No pressure or anything.\\n\\n## Back to the 80s! \u2728\\n\\n![Classic Game Show](./rooms.jpg)\\n\\nIn addition to the new game mode, we are also adding another free room with two different difficulties (the hard one is designed in collaboration with Wollo!) as part of this update! This time, you will find yourself on the set of a classic game show from the 80\'s. This room was specifically made with Versus Mode in mind, so you can definitely expect a truly challenging room this time around! Finally, we are also adding a brand-new outfit that will come in two different colors; red and blue! Will your team come out on top and steal the show? Only time will tell!\\n\\n# Build-A-Room #4: Versus Challenge!\\n\\n![Versus Challenge](./challenge.png)\\n\\nAs mentioned earlier on in this announcement, the next Build-A-Room contest kicks off **RIGHT NOW**! The only condition for this contest? Create your own Versus Room that is explicitly made to have players race against each other. But what can you win?
