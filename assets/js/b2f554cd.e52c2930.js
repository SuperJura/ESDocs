After two years of consistent updates and many, many amazing contributions from our community builders, we are truly proud to see how far our little escape room game has come! We are also incredibly thankful to each and every one of you for sticking with us and for checking out every update we\'ve added to the game since its initial launch. In this blog, we\'ll be looking back at the biggest accomplishments we\'ve seen throughout the past twelve months, but first... let\'s look at a nice summary in the form of a neat infographic! \ud83d\udcca\\n\\n![roadmap](./roadmap.jpg)\\n\\nAs you can see, the past twelve months have been incredible for all of us at Pine Studio and we can\'t express enough how much we appreciate all of your support. Now that we\'ve looked at some hard data, let\'s dive a little bit deeper into all of the changes and updates that have been made since the one-year anniversary of Escape Simulator!\\n\\n## Ghosts, cowboys, artists, pirates, game show competitors AND scientists? What\'s next?! \ud83e\udd2f\\n\\nIt really has been a busy year, hasn\'t it? Ever since the one-year anniversary of Escape Simulator, we have added four free rooms, one free DLC and one paid DLC to the game! We kicked things off by releasing the  free spooky Graveyard room just before last year\'s Halloween. In December, we launched the rootin\'-tootin\' [Wild West DLC](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2175260/Escape_Simulator_Wild_West_DLC/). In March, we added the free room Leonardo\'s Workshop, in which you can explore the many secrets of the grandmaster of arts and inventions: Leonardo da Vinci. \\n\\n![roadmap](./davinci.jpg)\\n\\n_Mamma mia! It\'s a ma-ma-masterpiece! \ud83c\udfa8_\\n\\nNext up, we didn\'t just add a single room, but an entire island. Treasure Island was another free room updated that allows you to live out all of your swashbuckling fantasies! Another surprising location came in the form of the free Versus Room, which has two difficulty modes and takes place on a game show from the 80\'s. This was part of the Versus Update, which also included Versus Mode, a brand-new way to experience the game with your frenemies!\\n\\n\\n![versus](./versus.gif)\\n\\n_Who\'s smarter? You or your friends? \ud83e\udde0_\\n\\nLast but certainly not least, we added the very first free DLC to Escape Simulator just last month. This cake had been in the oven for a while and we still can\'t believe it\'s not a lie! We\'re talking about the Portal Escape Chamber DLC, of course! It has been an incredible honour for us to work on this Portal-inspired room and we have tried to put as much of our love for this legendary game series into the room as possible. We would like to once again thank Valve for approving this amazing project and making this dream of ours come true. \ud83d\ude4c\\n\\n\\n![portal](./portal.jpg)\\n\\n_Have you already uncovered all of Aperture\'s secrets? \ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83d\udd2c_\\n\\nIn addition to all of the new content for escapists, we are still trying to add as many features and props to the in-game room editor. Some significant features that were added during the past twelve months include functional mirrors, in-game walkthroughs and the option to add flowing water! \ud83c\udf0a\\n\\nOnce again, the builders from our community proved their worth and showcased their creativity during the third and fourth editions of the Build-A-Room contest. The stakes were higher than ever with amazing prices like a trip to Paris, multiple Steam Decks, VR sets and even a cash prize of $2,000! Not everything turned out to be a competition however, as our community also proved that team work can lead to great accomplishments. One of our favourite initiatives from last year was the amazing community room The Collab: Museum!\\n\\n\\n![collab](./collab.jpg)\\n\\nFinally, we were beyond excited to reveal that the much requested VR version of Escape Simulator is officially in development. We can\'t wait to share more about this upcoming project and we hope you continue to look forward to it. In case you haven\'t already, be sure to add Escape Simulator VR to your wishlist!\\n\\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/app/2440240/Escape_Simulator_VR/\\n\\n\\n![vr](./vr.png)\\n\\n## ...and there\'s still more where that came from! \ud83d\udc40\\n\\nThe fun won\'t stop, because we still have a lot more stuff planned for Escape Simulator! By now you might already be familiar with our roadmap for 2023, but just in case you haven\'t seen it already, let\'s have another look!\\n\\n![roadmap future](./roadmap2.jpg)\\n\\nAs you can see, we still have some surprises in store for you this year, but what happens after 2023? Well, we are delighted to tell you that plenty of new plans are already in the works for the upcoming year! We hope you\'ll continue to look forward to even more awesome content and in the meantime, we would like to thank all of you one final time for your continuous support.

That\'s right, **we are kicking off our fourth official Build-A-Room challenge TODAY**! As always, there are some awesome prizes involved. Be sure to keep reading for more information on this new Build-A-Room challenge down below!\\n\\nThe Versus Update is absolutely huge and it features a new game mode, new rooms, soundtrack, outfits, a few very interesting additions (such as \\"join random multiplayer lobby\\" option), and a bunch of fixes. The full massive **changelog is in the bottom of the page**.\\n\\n## But how does it work?\\n\\n![Versus Mode](./lb.gif)\\n\\nAs the title implies, in this brand-new Versus Mode, you will be able to take on other players to prove that you are the greatest escape artist. Just like in the regular Co-op Mode, one player will need to host a game to create a lobby for your opponents to join. Once that\'s settled, you\u2019ll have to select a room that each of you will be tackling individually. You can choose any room you want, even the community rooms made in the in-game room editor!\\n\\nOnce you\'ve selected and entered a room, the game begins. In order to keep track of how far along your opponents are, we\'ve added an in-game progress bar that shows you exactly whether you\'re ahead of the game or if you should step it up a notch! This progress bar will allow you to see the exact progress of your opponents. No pressure or anything.\\n\\n## Back to the 80s! \u2728\\n\\n![Classic Game Show](./rooms.jpg)\\n\\nIn addition to the new game mode, we are also adding another free room with two different difficulties (the hard one is designed in collaboration with Wollo!) as part of this update! This time, you will find yourself on the set of a classic game show from the 80\'s. This room was specifically made with Versus Mode in mind, so you can definitely expect a truly challenging room this time around! Finally, we are also adding a brand-new outfit that will come in two different colors; red and blue! Will your team come out on top and steal the show? Only time will tell!\\n\\n# Build-A-Room #4: Versus Challenge!\\n\\n![Versus Challenge](./challenge.png)\\n\\nAs mentioned earlier on in this announcement, the next Build-A-Room contest kicks off **RIGHT NOW**!

And what a year it has been for all of us at Pine Studio! \\n\\n![roadmap](./roadmap.jpg)\\n\\nTo celebrate the first anniversary of Escape Simulator, we\'re looking back at everything that has been achieved so far, while also giving you a sneak peek of what\'s yet to come. Join us for another dev update and feel free tell us your favorite memory of the game so far in the comment section down below! If you do so, and give this a announcement a like, you might win a key for our upcoming DLC (once it\'s out)!\\n\\n_Update: The two lucky winners of the Wild West DLC are Lyalya and -Swervin-! You will be contacted by our community manager for the Steam keys!_\\n\\n## The journey so far...\\n\\nWhen Escape Simulator first released one year ago, the base game featured 15 rooms spread out across three different themes. So far, that number has been increased to 23 and we still have more free rooms planned! Five of these were part of the Omega Corporation update and of course we also added three extra rooms: Santa\'s Workshop, Cats In Time and the recently released 70\'s Room. Additionally, we released the [Steampunk DLC](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1942100/Escape_Simulator_Steampunk_DLC/) back in June and we just announced a [second DLC](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2175260/Escape_Simulator_Wild_West_DLC/) as well! More on that in a bit! \ud83d\ude09\\n\\nOf course, Escape Simulator also owes a lot to its incredible community! That\'s why we want to give a massive shoutout to all of the builders who keep surprising both us and all other puzzle fans with awesome content. So far, there are already over **3000** published rooms to check out on the [Steam Workshop](https://steamcommunity.com/app/1435790/workshop/)! We also loved to see all of the excellent entries we received during the three different builder competitions that took place so far.\\n\\nOf course our room editor has also gone through a lot of changes since the initial release. A whole bunch of new features have been added, with the [Room Editor 2.0](https://steamcommunity.com/games/1435790/announcements/detail/3367016884694436693) update being our biggest update to the editor so far. As you might recall, that update featured the addition of new lighting options, scripting with LUA, a model importer and many more quality of life tweaks. \\n\\nFinally, we are happy to say that Escape Simulator is now playable in a grand total of **twelve languages**, eleven of which have been added post-launch! We have also added gamepad support, so you can play the game however you want. We were astounded to the see game reach over ONE MILLION players and we hope you\'ll stick with us for even more escape fun! Now, are you ready for a sneak peek on the future of the game? \ud83d\udc40\\n\\n## ...and what lies beyond! \ud83d\ude80\\n\\n\\n![Wild West](./ww.png)\\n\\nSo if you\'ve been keeping an eye on this channel, you might already know that a second DLC is coming to Escape Simulator!

Featuring four additional rooms that are filled to the brim with all kinds of curious machinery, this DLC is sure to get your gears grinding! To celebrate the arrival of this new content, both Escape Simulator and the Steampunk DLC are currently on sale! Additionally, you can now get all available content directly through the newly available Escape Simulator: Collector\'s Edition. This bundle is also available if you already own Escape Simulator and will add the content that you don\'t own yet to your Steam wallet. If you can\'t wait to board the Valor, then you can get the Steampunk DLC right [here](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1942100/Escape_Simulator_Steampunk_DLC/)!\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\nEach room in this DLC represents a different area of the steampunk airship \u2018Valor\u2019. Your journey through the Valor begins at The Crew Quarters, where you are awoken by a sudden explosion. You\u2019ll have to make your way topside by putting out fires in The Engine Room and by taking care of the plants in The Greenhouse. Will you be able to make it to The Helm Room on time and regain control of the airship?\\n\\n## Bring your community rooms to the next level!\\nIn addition to all of the newly available Steampunk content, we are also releasing the free \u2018**Room Editor 2.0**\u2019 update today! This update will greatly expand the amount of possibilities for builders to make awesome community rooms! Additionally, builders will also get access to all of the Steampunk DLC assets, regardless of whether they bought the DLC or not. \\n\\nTo start things off, the latest version of the Room Editor now allows room builders to add all types of **lighting** to their rooms! With this feature, you\u2019ll be able to really crank up the atmosphere in your creations. Additionally, we are adding post-processing options and a brand new model importer! With this model importer, builders are now able to add their own assets to their rooms, which will open up a world of opportunities!\\n\\n![light](./roomLight.gif)\\n\\nFinally, the new Room Editor also adds a function which allows builders to make use of **LUA scripting**. Through scripting, builders will be able to modify the properties of their rooms to their own will. Like with the other added functions, we believe this will allow builders to further create rooms that are beyond our imagination!\\n\\nFor more information on the contents of the Room Editor 2.0 update, see the patch notes below!\\n\\n## So what\u2019s next for Escape Simulator?\\nWe\u2019ve been working hard to continue improving the Escape Simulator experience and there\u2019s still a lot more awesome stuff coming up! That said, we are well aware that we couldn\u2019t have done any of this without all of your support. We are truly glad to have such a great community and we hope you\u2019ll continue to enjoy all of the upcoming updates. Currently we are still working on two free additional rooms that will be revealed at a later point, so be sure to keep an eye on our channels for more information!
