# Open Link

Used to open a website link via the Steam Overlay. This Logic prop needs to be targeted directly by a button that the player presses ingame to prevent rooms from spamming players with links. There are only a few whitelisted websites you can link with this component and they are named below. If the link you pasted into the Link (Steam/Wiki) turns red once you click out of the field it means there is something wrong with it and the game will ignore the Open Link component and not open the link.
Intended purpose is for showing off your other created rooms, linking a guide to the current room or giving the players more information needed for a puzzle via a Wikipedia page.
