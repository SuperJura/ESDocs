## ðŸ’¡Tips
- Start the room and move to all edges of the room to see where players can squeeze through tight spaces, or clip into walls. That's where you'll want to add extra obstacles. You can also try running through walls and doors to see if players can clip through.
- It can be used to stop a player temporarily from entering a space when used in combination with an activator or an animation.
- It is recommended to place the obstacle on the floor so you can easily see where you're blocking the player from moving.
