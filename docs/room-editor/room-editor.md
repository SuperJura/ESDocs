# Room Editor Overview

## Testimonials

> What impresses me most about Escape Simulator's room editor is that it is smartly designed to be both accessible to absolute newcomers while providing an extremely high skill ceiling for experienced room builders. Even without using the built-in lua framework, one can create nuanced logic by chaining together the basic lock, empty, activator, slot, trigger logic objects. Instead of grappling with the intricacies of the room editor, builders can focus on the actual level design.
