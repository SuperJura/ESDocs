            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<iframe width="100%" height="500" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/weeOjkY0Ais" title="Escape Simulator: Versus Update - Out now!" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"></iframe><h1>Are you ready for a battle of the brains? üß†</h1><p>Always wondered if you were the one with the biggest brain among your friends? Today you'll be able to find out for yourself by challenging them in Escape Simulator's brand-new Versus Update! Rise to the top of the ranks by being the first to solve all the puzzles in one of our many escape rooms. To commemorate this new way to play, we are also adding a truly challenging room that takes place on a quiz show from the 80s.</p><p>Finally, we would like to challenge all of our community's incredibly talented room builders to create their own Versus rooms! That's right, <strong>we are kicking off our fourth official Build-A-Room challenge TODAY</strong>! As always, there are some awesome prizes involved. Be sure to keep reading for more information on this new Build-A-Room challenge down below!</p><p>The Versus Update is absolutely huge and it features a new game mode, new rooms, soundtrack, outfits, a few very interesting additions (such as "join random multiplayer lobby" option), and a bunch of fixes. The full massive <strong>changelog is in the bottom of the page</strong>.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="but-how-does-it-work">But how does it work?<a href="#but-how-does-it-work" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to But how does it work?" title="Direct link to But how does it work?">‚Äã</a></h2><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Versus Mode" src="/ESDocs/assets/images/lb-84883a0ee98b1dc518bb2d8f1700247e.gif" width="600" height="337" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>As the title implies, in this brand-new Versus Mode, you will be able to take on other players to prove that you are the greatest escape artist. Just like in the regular Co-op Mode, one player will need to host a game to create a lobby for your opponents to join. Once that's settled, you‚Äôll have to select a room that each of you will be tackling individually. You can choose any room you want, even the community rooms made in the in-game room editor!</p><p>Once you've selected and entered a room, the game begins. In order to keep track of how far along your opponents are, we've added an in-game progress bar that shows you exactly whether you're ahead of the game or if you should step it up a notch! This progress bar will allow you to see the exact progress of your opponents. No pressure or anything.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="back-to-the-80s-">Back to the 80s! ‚ú®<a href="#back-to-the-80s-" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Back to the 80s! ‚ú®" title="Direct link to Back to the 80s! ‚ú®">‚Äã</a></h2><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Classic Game Show" src="/ESDocs/assets/images/rooms-52065626059047bd095c366315dfd968.jpg" width="1134" height="344" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>In addition to the new game mode, we are also adding another free room with two different difficulties (the hard one is designed in collaboration with Wollo!) as part of this update! This time, you will find yourself on the set of a classic game show from the 80's. This room was specifically made with Versus Mode in mind, so you can definitely expect a truly challenging room this time around! Finally, we are also adding a brand-new outfit that will come in two different colors; red and blue! Will your team come out on top and steal the show? Only time will tell!</p><h1>Build-A-Room #4: Versus Challenge!</h1><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Versus Challenge" src="/ESDocs/assets/images/challenge-765e56195a31a9030567839efab9bb8b.png" width="700" height="187" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>As mentioned earlier on in this announcement, the next Build-A-Room contest kicks off <strong>RIGHT NOW</strong>!

That's right, we're releasing a brand-new room for Escape Simulator <strong>today</strong>! In order to escape from this incredibly cozy looking room, you'll need to know your way around some 'ancient' technology, such as cassette decks and a very retro game console. So vintage!</p><p>That's not all, though! The <strong>70's room</strong> is part of our latest update, which also contains a whole bunch of additional features for the room editor. We hope you're excited to start using these features, builders! Additionally, this update contains the following tweaks:</p><ul><li>Different internal level packing, the game should be smaller on disk. It's about 5GB smaller than before!</li><li>New hint system that tracks what puzzle you are playing and gives relevant hints</li><li>Localization fixes</li><li>Separated settings and save files. Only save is uploaded to cloud save, meaning settings is local to the machine.</li><li>Faster performance mode for custom rooms</li><li>Disable shadows option has 2x increased FPS in built-in rooms</li><li>Chat key is can be rebound to different key</li><li>Changed how zooms are calculated, some items are now bigger for better clarity</li><li>Better controller support</li><li>Better support for breaking hanging objects (plants, mirrors, ...)</li><li>Its easier to use slots with controller with new Controller-Slot interaction UX</li></ul><p>More patch notes can be found right here!</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="more-rooms-to-check-out-">More rooms to check out! üëÄ<a href="#more-rooms-to-check-out-" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to More rooms to check out! üëÄ" title="Direct link to More rooms to check out! üëÄ">‚Äã</a></h2><p>We really hope you'll enjoy this free update and that you'll continue to look forward to even more rooms in the future!

Featuring four additional rooms that are filled to the brim with all kinds of curious machinery, this DLC is sure to get your gears grinding! To celebrate the arrival of this new content, both Escape Simulator and the Steampunk DLC are currently on sale! Additionally, you can now get all available content directly through the newly available Escape Simulator: Collector's Edition. This bundle is also available if you already own Escape Simulator and will add the content that you don't own yet to your Steam wallet. If you can't wait to board the Valor, then you can get the Steampunk DLC right <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1942100/Escape_Simulator_Steampunk_DLC/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>!</p><p>Each room in this DLC represents a different area of the steampunk airship ‚ÄòValor‚Äô. Your journey through the Valor begins at The Crew Quarters, where you are awoken by a sudden explosion. You‚Äôll have to make your way topside by putting out fires in The Engine Room and by taking care of the plants in The Greenhouse. Will you be able to make it to The Helm Room on time and regain control of the airship?</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="bring-your-community-rooms-to-the-next-level">Bring your community rooms to the next level!<a href="#bring-your-community-rooms-to-the-next-level" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Bring your community rooms to the next level!" title="Direct link to Bring your community rooms to the next level!">‚Äã</a></h2><p>In addition to all of the newly available Steampunk content, we are also releasing the free ‚Äò<strong>Room Editor 2.0</strong>‚Äô update today! This update will greatly expand the amount of possibilities for builders to make awesome community rooms! Additionally, builders will also get access to all of the Steampunk DLC assets, regardless of whether they bought the DLC or not. </p><p>To start things off, the latest version of the Room Editor now allows room builders to add all types of <strong>lighting</strong> to their rooms! With this feature, you‚Äôll be able to really crank up the atmosphere in your creations. Additionally, we are adding post-processing options and a brand new model importer! With this model importer, builders are now able to add their own assets to their rooms, which will open up a world of opportunities!</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="light" src="/ESDocs/assets/images/roomLight-97c5b4f4e6f18a508cf74b18f45f0a8d.gif" width="600" height="341" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Finally, the new Room Editor also adds a function which allows builders to make use of <strong>LUA scripting</strong>. Through scripting, builders will be able to modify the properties of their rooms to their own will. Like with the other added functions, we believe this will allow builders to further create rooms that are beyond our imagination!</p><p>For more information on the contents of the Room Editor 2.0 update, see the patch notes below!</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="so-whats-next-for-escape-simulator">So what‚Äôs next for Escape Simulator?<a href="#so-whats-next-for-escape-simulator" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to So what‚Äôs next for Escape Simulator?" title="Direct link to So what‚Äôs next for Escape Simulator?">‚Äã</a></h2><p>We‚Äôve been working hard to continue improving the Escape Simulator experience and there‚Äôs still a lot more awesome stuff coming up! That said, we are well aware that we couldn‚Äôt have done any of this without all of your support. We are truly glad to have such a great community and we hope you‚Äôll continue to enjoy all of the upcoming updates. Currently we are still working on two free additional rooms that will be revealed at a later point, so be sure to keep an eye on our channels for more information!

Today we will be adding no less than <strong>five</strong> language options to the game. Once this update goes live, you will be able to play the entire game in T√ºrk (Turkish), Espa√±ol (Spanish), Espa√±ol (Spanish Latin America), Portugu√™s (Portuguese) and Portugu√™s (Portuguese Brasil)! We know that a lot of you have been waiting very patiently for this specific update, so we are very glad to reveal that the wait is finally over!</p><h1>New publishing options üìù</h1><p>Additionally, we have completely reworked the 'Publish custom room screen'. This update includes several new options you can adjust when publishing your custom room to Steam Workshop. First off, you can now change the visibility settings of your room before publishing. This also allows you to publish your room directly from the Room Editor. Furthermore, you will be able to change the description of your room and add new Patch Notes. Lastly, this update also enables the option to add Steam Workshop tags to your room, which should make it much easier for other players to find exactly what they are looking for. üëÄ</p><h1>Additional updates and tweaks (v1.0.20730r)</h1><details class="details_lb9f alert alert--info details_b_Ee" data-collapsed="true"><summary><h4>Changelog</h4></summary><div><div class="collapsibleContent_i85q"><ul><li>New trigger option: Trigger when all players enter the trigger</li><li>New lock option: Added parity XOR and exclusive XOR</li><li>New hair options for Cori's dad üôÇ</li><li>New languages</li><li>Game optimizations, should run more smoothly and take less memory</li><li>Loop animations soft-lock in custom rooms fixed</li><li>UX tweaks for controller and general feel of the game so it is more uniform</li></ul></div></div></details>]]></content:encoded>
