Attention Crewmates!

We‚Äôve received an emergency call from The Mini Skeld! They seem to be running into some issues with the ship. Could there possibly be an Impostor amongst the crew? Time to board the ship and help the crew escape in this new **official Among Us**-inspired room, available now for everyone!

You and your Crewmates have to work together, solve puzzles and make your way out. However, now that you‚Äôre stuck in space, the stakes may be even higher! Or, maybe you and your friends are all just hard-working, puzzle-solving, qualified space adventurers and you have absolutely nothing to worry about.

##  Lightning fast escape 

Taking care of a spaceship is never easy. Especially when you have a lot of things to worry about such as the O2 running out, reactors in meltdown or the worst of all, no internet connection. For the Crewmates that want a real challenge, if you‚Äôre able to escape from the ship within an hour, you‚Äôll win a special trophy!
