Today you'll be able to find out for yourself by challenging them in Escape Simulator's brand-new Versus Update! Rise to the top of the ranks by being the first to solve all the puzzles in one of our many escape rooms. To commemorate this new way to play, we are also adding a truly challenging room that takes place on a quiz show from the 80s.</p><p>Finally, we would like to challenge all of our community's incredibly talented room builders to create their own Versus rooms! That's right, <strong>we are kicking off our fourth official Build-A-Room challenge TODAY</strong>! As always, there are some awesome prizes involved. Be sure to keep reading for more information on this new Build-A-Room challenge down below!</p><p>The Versus Update is absolutely huge and it features a new game mode, new rooms, soundtrack, outfits, a few very interesting additions (such as "join random multiplayer lobby" option), and a bunch of fixes. The full massive <strong>changelog is in the bottom of the page</strong>.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="but-how-does-it-work">But how does it work?<a href="#but-how-does-it-work" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to But how does it work?" title="Direct link to But how does it work?">‚Äã</a></h2><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Versus Mode" src="/ESDocs/assets/images/lb-84883a0ee98b1dc518bb2d8f1700247e.gif" width="600" height="337" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>As the title implies, in this brand-new Versus Mode, you will be able to take on other players to prove that you are the greatest escape artist. Just like in the regular Co-op Mode, one player will need to host a game to create a lobby for your opponents to join. Once that's settled, you‚Äôll have to select a room that each of you will be tackling individually. You can choose any room you want, even the community rooms made in the in-game room editor!</p><p>Once you've selected and entered a room, the game begins. In order to keep track of how far along your opponents are, we've added an in-game progress bar that shows you exactly whether you're ahead of the game or if you should step it up a notch! This progress bar will allow you to see the exact progress of your opponents. No pressure or anything.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="back-to-the-80s-">Back to the 80s! ‚ú®<a href="#back-to-the-80s-" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Back to the 80s! ‚ú®" title="Direct link to Back to the 80s! ‚ú®">‚Äã</a></h2><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Classic Game Show" src="/ESDocs/assets/images/rooms-52065626059047bd095c366315dfd968.jpg" width="1134" height="344" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>In addition to the new game mode, we are also adding another free room with two different difficulties (the hard one is designed in collaboration with Wollo!) as part of this update! This time, you will find yourself on the set of a classic game show from the 80's. This room was specifically made with Versus Mode in mind, so you can definitely expect a truly challenging room this time around! Finally, we are also adding a brand-new outfit that will come in two different colors; red and blue! Will your team come out on top and steal the show? Only time will tell!</p><h1>Build-A-Room #4: Versus Challenge!</h1><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Versus Challenge" src="/ESDocs/assets/images/challenge-765e56195a31a9030567839efab9bb8b.png" width="700" height="187" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>As mentioned earlier on in this announcement, the next Build-A-Room contest kicks off <strong>RIGHT NOW</strong>!
